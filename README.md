# credential-badges

Static assets served at `https://credentials.andamio.io`. Hosts the JSON-LD context and supporting documents for Andamio Open Badges 3.0 credentials.

> Badge images are **build output** — regenerate them with `make badges`. See [`generator/README.md`](generator/README.md) for the pipeline, and [`MOC.md`](MOC.md) to map the repo.

**Release: v1.0 (mainnet core), live since 2026-06-29.** Any credential renders and serves on demand at `credentials.andamio.io/badges/<policy_id>.<slt_hash>.svg`, on Cardano mainnet, static-first with an on-demand render fallback. The portable/verifiable layer (signing, `did:web`, SDK, standalone viewer) is **v1.1 (Q3)**; see [`ROADMAP.md`](ROADMAP.md). Note: the repo release tag (`v1.0.0`) is separate from the JSON-LD **schema** version, which is still `v0` (pre-stable); the stable `v1.jsonld` ships with v1.1.

## What's here

| Path | Served at | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `context/v0.jsonld` | `credentials.andamio.io/context/v0.jsonld` | **Pre-stable** JSON-LD context for Andamio's OB 3.0 extension terms (`onChainAnchor`, `onChainAttestation`, `accessToken`, `requires`, `prereqAttestation`). Used by spike credentials while the schema iterates toward v1. |
| `issuer/profile.jsonld` | `credentials.andamio.io/issuer` | Hosted OB 3.0 issuer `Profile`. Credentials carry `issuer.url` = this URL; strict verifiers (e.g. 1EdTech) dereference it and expect `application/ld+json`. Served at the extensionless path `/issuer` via an nginx exact-match. **Mutable** (unlike versioned contexts) — cached but not `immutable`. |
| `badges/*.svg` (+ `.png`) | `credentials.andamio.io/badges/...` | Presentation-layer badge imagery referenced by `achievement.image` in OB 3.0 credentials. **Never identity-bearing** — the on-chain anchor is the credential's identity; the image is a mutable pointer. SVG-primary (git-diffable, no history bloat). **Mutable** — cached but not `immutable`. `_placeholder.svg` is a demo asset. |

## Badge imagery

The `badges/` directory holds the visual artifacts referenced by
`achievement.image` in OB 3.0 credentials:

```
credentials.andamio.io/context/v0.jsonld          ← schema (immutable, versioned)
credentials.andamio.io/badges/{...}.svg           ← imagery (mutable)
```

The `image` field is standard OB 3.0 (no `andamio:` extension). Hosting lives
here so badges sit next to the schema they belong to. **v1 design decision**
(full rationale in the `credential-imagery` design doc in the OB 3.0 spike;
work tracked as repo issues):

- **Presentation-layer only.** The image is *never* identity-bearing. A
  credential's identity is its on-chain anchor; the image is a pointer the
  credential carries. An issuer may refresh badge art at any time without
  invalidating any issued credential — hence the non-`immutable` cache.
- **Keys off `badge_id`** (a badge = any subset of 1+ modules), not the
  course or the SLT.
- **SVG-primary**, optional small PNG fallback (~512×512). SVG is text:
  git-diffable, no history bloat, scales crisply.

The badge filename is `<policy_id>.<slt_hash>.svg`: the credential's on-chain
**course policy id** (56-hex) paired with its SLT hash. (In Andamio a course is
identified by its course-NFT minting policy; that policy id is the filename key,
not a separate course identifier.) In production use as of `v0.0.3`, 2026-05-25
with the 4 *Andamio for Developers* per-module badges. The broader `badge_id`
registry (a badge spanning a subset of modules) will be formalized in
`docs/badge-registry.md` (Issue #11, Unit 6).

Still to settle (tracked as issues, decision-coupled to the issuer-identity
work): whether per-org badges live in this repo or per-issuer repos long-term
(Issues #4 / #6 / #11 — coupled to the Unit 6 designed-not-built per-org
issuer DID work).

## How badges resolve

Badge serving is **static-first with an on-demand render fallback** (#33), so
*any* credential resolves at `credentials.andamio.io/badges/<policy_id>.<slt_hash>.svg`
without every badge being pre-generated:

1. **Static hit** — if the SVG is in the pre-generated set baked into the static
   host, nginx serves it straight from disk.
2. **Miss → `@render`** — a `/badges/` miss returns nginx `404 → @render`, which
   proxies to a second Cloud Run service (`credential-badges-render`).
3. **Render + cache** — the render service reads the course/module titles from
   the andamio-api gateway (network-scoped `X-API-Key` from Secret Manager),
   renders the SVG, and writes it to a GCS cache. Repeat requests serve from the
   cache; the gateway is only hit on a cold miss.

The deployed credential set resolves on the **mainnet** gateway (the render
service tries `BADGE_NETWORKS` in order). Titles are the only thing fetched —
the badge geometry is the proof-ring encoding of the on-chain credential, so the
art is reproducible offline (`make badges`).

Operating the cache (invalidate a stale title, reconcile orphaned objects):
`scripts/cache-admin.py` — see [`docs/cache.md`](docs/cache.md). The two-service
topology, the deploy triggers, and the infra apply order are in
[`DEPLOY.md`](DEPLOY.md); gateway-key provisioning + rotation is in
[`docs/runbooks/gateway-key.md`](docs/runbooks/gateway-key.md).

## Versioning

- **`v0`** is the **pre-stable** schema. Expect breaking changes. Demo credentials issued against v0 (e.g. the OB 3.0 spike's james and njuguna samples) are explicitly snapshots of in-flight work, not durable references.
- **`v1`** is the first stable schema. Once published, `v1.jsonld` never changes — any further change ships as `v2.jsonld`. Credentials reference a specific version in their `@context` array, so locking a version locks the schema the credential was signed against.
- Both `v0` and `v1` (and any subsequent versions) are hosted indefinitely once published — credentials in the wild reference their version forever, so the URL must keep resolving.

### Two version axes (don't conflate them)

The **repo release tag** and the **JSON-LD schema version** are independent, and their numbers do not line up. The stable schema (`v1.jsonld`) ships with credential-badges **v1.1**, not v1.0:

| Axis | At v1.0 (today) | At v1.1 (Q3) |
|---|---|---|
| Repo / release tag | `v1.0.0` | `v1.1.0` |
| JSON-LD schema context | `v0` (pre-stable) | `v1` (stable) |

Tagging the repo `v1.0.0` deploys the host but does **not** make the schema stable. The schema goes stable only when the v1.1 signing layer (Ed25519, `did:web`, OB 3.0 baking) lands, because a frozen `v1.jsonld` is what verifiers check against.

## How it gets deployed

Hosted on Google Cloud Run (`andamio-credentials` GCP project) with a custom domain mapping to `credentials.andamio.io`. Infra is managed with Terraform in a private operations repository. Deployment is **tag-triggered** via GitHub Actions + Workload Identity Federation — pushing a `vX.Y.Z` tag builds the image and deploys it. There is intentionally **no branch/`main` deploy**: the WIF binding is ref-constrained to `refs/tags/v*` at the OIDC assertion level, so only tag pushes can mint a deploy token.

For the full deploy mechanism, allowlist rule, and tag policy, see [`DEPLOY.md`](DEPLOY.md).

## How to update

1. Open a PR. Context files are immutable — only fix typos or add a **new** version file; never edit a published version in place. CI enforces the served-file allowlist.
2. Merge to `main`.
3. Push a version tag: `git tag v0.1.2 && git push origin v0.1.2`. GitHub Actions builds, pushes (SHA + semver tags, never `:latest`), and deploys. Artifact Registry has immutable tags — re-pushing an existing tag is rejected, so always bump.
4. Verify `https://credentials.andamio.io/context/v0.jsonld` resolves with `Content-Type: application/ld+json` and is byte-identical to the repo copy.

## Beyond the served files

The repo also houses material that is **not** baked into the served image (the served-file allowlist in `Dockerfile` + `scripts/ci/check-allowlist.sh` enforces this):

- [`ROADMAP.md`](ROADMAP.md) — living public checklist of where this repo is going. Start here if you want to know what's next.
- [`MOC.md`](MOC.md) — one-screen map of every component in this stack.
- `docs/plans/` — the OB 3.0 issuer deployment plan that will stand up a sibling Cloud Run service (`credential-badges-issuer`) at `credentials.andamio.io/credentials/*`.
- `spike/` — the validated OB 3.0 prototype (TypeScript, end-to-end) the plan promotes from.
- `spike/verifier-spike/` — the Phase 0 pre-flight verifier spike (2026-05-25, 1EdTech green; mapper findings folded into the plan).

## Background

These extension terms came out of the Andamio Open Badges 3.0 spike (April–May 2026). The spike is committed at `spike/` in this repo (source of truth); the full deployment plan that promotes it lives at `docs/plans/2026-05-16-001-feat-andamio-ob3-issuer-deployment-plan.md`.
